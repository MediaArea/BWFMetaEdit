<h3>LIST-INFO Audio Metadata Information</h3>
<table border='1' summary="This table lists the identifiers and descriptions of the LIST-INFO subchunks">
<tr><th>Chunk ID</th><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>IARL</td><td>Archival Location</td><td>Indicates where the subject of the file is archived.<br/><br/>
<b>FADGI Application:</b><p>This element is an approximate equivalent to the Originator element in the BEXT chunk which records the entity responsible for the 'archiving' (creation, maintenance, preservation) of this digital item. If used, this element could repeat the data from the Originator element in the same structured format. In some applications, it is automatically carried over to the MP3 ID3 element 'ArchivalLocation.' Of all the info list chunk elements, this is the most important for Federal Agencies because it is vital to document the archival responsibility for a content item.</p>
<p>Entity designations should be as specific as possible including a two-character county code to avoid the potential for conflict in the archiving entity’s name. The archival entity should be identified at the most specific level within the institution.</p>
<b>FADGI Requirement:</b> Strongly recommended ('required') if using LIST-INFO chunk.<br/><br/>

<b>FADGI Formatting:</b><ol><li>Two capital letters which must be derived from <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes/iso_3166_code_lists.htm">ISO 3166 Country Codes</a></a></li><li>One comma</li><li>One space</li><li>Institutional Acronym. Almost always one word all caps but there are some acronyms that are more than one word. The resource <a href='http://members.cox.net/govdocs/govspeak.html'>GovSpeak: A Guide to Government Acronyms and Abbreviations</a> is suggested as a source but not required.</li><li>This string should be identical to what is in the Originator data space. If any fields in LIST-INFO are used, this data should automatically carry over from Originator.</li></ol><b>FADGI Examples:</b><br/>US, NARA<br/>US, LOC/RSS<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>IART</td><td>Artist</td><td>Lists the artist of the original subject of the file. For example, Michaelangelo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ICMS</td><td>Commissioned</td><td>Lists the name of the person or organization that commissioned the subject of the file. For example, Pope Julian II.</td></tr><tr><td>ICMT</td><td>Comments</td><td>Provides general comments about the file or the subject of the file. If the comment is several sentences long, end each sentence with a period. Do not include newline characters.<br/><br/>
<b>FADGI Application:</b><p>If used, this element should repeat the principal and other identifiers from the OriginatorReference and/or Description element in the BEXT chunk. Each identifier will be labeled as to its origin or purpose using the 'type' and 'comment' qualifiers. Using the tag 'local' in the 'type' qualifier implies the entity identified in the BEXT Originator element. In some applications, this info list element may carry forward automatically to the MP3 ID3 tagged element 'Comment.'</p><p>NOTE: The Working Group perceived value in the practices of labeling identifiers (see examples) but wished to leave this as an optional practice.</p><br/>
<b>FADGI Requirement:</b> Optional<br/><br/><b>FADGI Formatting:</b><br/>If labeled: Identifier [comma space] type [comma space] comment [semicolon-space if more than one identifier]<br/>If no labeling: Identifier<br/><br/><b>FADGI Examples:</b><table border='1'><tr><td>NARA</td><td>58979818, local, principal ID original filename</td></tr><tr><td>NARA</td><td>306-MUSA-9658B, local, RG-Series-Item Number</td></tr><tr><td>LC</td><td>1201566-2-1, local, system-generated number; RYI 6039, local, source location number</td></tr><tr><td>LC</td><td>http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mbrsmi/westhpp.2033, URL, principal ID Handle</td></tr><tr><td>Digital Library</td><td>ark.cdlib.org.org/ark:/13030/tf5p30086k, URL, ARK</td></tr><tr><td>LC</td><td>http://lccn.loc.gov/mp76000002</td></tr></table></td></tr>
<tr><td>ICOP</td><td>Copyright</td><td>Records the copyright information for the file. For example, Copyright Encyclopedia International 1991. If there are multiple copyrights, separate them by a semicolon followed by a space.<br/><br/>
<b>FADGI Application:</b><p>Information about copyright and other restrictions (donor, privacy, etc.). Usage by federal agencies will often refer to the documentation of restrictions provided by other, non- embedded metadata. This element has no equivalent in the BEXT chunk. In some applications, this info list element may carry forward automatically to MP3 ID3 tagged element 'Copyright.'</p>
<p>If used, this element may contain the information as known at the time of embedding. The Working Group understands that metadata may be updated over time. Users who refer to an embedded block of metadata should understand that this may not represent the latest and best information, and they should be counseled to follow one of the identifiers in order to obtain later and/or better data.</p><br/>
<b>FADGI Requirement:</b> Optional<br/><br/>

<b>FADGI Application:</b><p>This element is an equivalent to the OriginationDate in the BEXT chunk.
