			<div>
				<h4>EBU Tech 3285 definition:</h4>
				<ul>
				<li>ASCII string (maximum 256 characters) containing a free description of the sequence. To help applications which only display a short description, it is recommended that a resume of the description is contained in the first 64 characters, and the last 192 characters are use for details.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>FADGI recommendations:</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Two capital letters which must be derived from <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes/iso_3166_code_lists.htm">ISO 3166 Country Codes</a></li>					<li>One comma</li>
					<li>One space</li>					<li>Acronym. The great majority of acronyms are one word in all caps but there are some acronyms that are more than one word. The resource GovSpeak: A Guide to <a href="http://members.cox.net/govdocs/govspeak.html">Government Acronyms and Abbreviations</a> is suggested as a source but not required.</li>					<li>If string entered is under 32 characters, allow free-text string of up to 32 characters. End field with a null character.</li>					<li>This string should be automatically entered into the IARL data space.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>COMMENT: This element is recommended as a container for identifiers for the work at hand and/or as pointers to additional, non-embedded (externally maintained) metadata. Members of the Working Group have repeatedly encountered the need to provide multiple identifiers for a given item. The resulting extent of data cannot be accommodated in the OriginatorReference element. For these reasons, the Working Group's recommendations for the Description element deviate from the EBU specification.</p><p>In some cases, the 256-character limit will prevent an agency from listing all of its identifiers; the most important or helpful should be provided.</p><p>Do not embed identifiers which could pose a possible security risk, e.g., by exposing exact pathnames.</p><p>NOTE: The Working Group perceived value in two practices but wished to leave these as optional. The first is the tagging of identifiers (see examples, typically URLs) to permit them to be properly understood.	The second is the repetition of the principal identifier (as provided without tagging) in OriginatorReference as the first identifier in Description, where labeling as to its origin or purpose can be provided. Comments from readers are welcome.</p>
                <h4>FADGI Requirements:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Strongly recommended (if the Working Group had authority: "required")</li>
			    </ul>
			    <h4>FADGI Formatting:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>If labeled: Identifier [comma space] type [comma space] comment [semicolon-space if more than one identifier]</li><li>If no labeling: Identifier</li>

				</ul>
				<h4>FADGI Application:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><p>This element contains the entity responsible for the "archiving" (creation, maintenance, preservation) of this digital item. Entity designations should be as specific as possible including a two-character county code to avoid the potential for conflict in the archiving entity’s name.</p><p>If space permits within the 32 character limit, the archival entity should be identified at the most specific level within the institution.</p><p>Use a standard abbreviation of entity names such as those found in the Guide to Government Acronyms & Abbreviations. If an entity is not on this list, use a familiar abbreviation. Use the standard two-character ISO 3166 alpha 2 country code list.</p></li>

					<li>ISO 8601 YYYY-MM-DD.

The separator between the items is a hyphen [-] with no spaces. Note: the Working Group adheres to the ISO 8601 truncation convention: the year should always be given but, if unknown, values for month and day are omitted. Thus the string length may be four, seven, or ten. If the string entered is less than ten characters, end it with a null character.</li>
