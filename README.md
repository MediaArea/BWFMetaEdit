* git
* automake
* autoconf
* libtool
* pkgconfig
* make
* g++

*CLI and GUI dependencies*

* zlib

*GUI only dependencies*

* qt

#### Ubuntu

*Build tools and CLI/GUI dependencies*

```sh
apt-get install git automake autoconf libtool pkg-config make g++ zlib1g-dev
```

*GUI only dependencies*

```sh
apt-get install qtbase5-dev qtdeclarative5-dev qtquickcontrols2-5-dev libqt5svg5-dev

```sh
sudo dnf install qt5-qtbase-devel qt5-qtquickcontrols2-devel qt5-qtsvg-devel
```

### Build BWF MetaEdit CLI


When you have done all the prerequisite for your configuration, then build BWF MetaEdit. We start with the CLI.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MediaArea/BWFMetaEdit.git
cd BWFMetaEdit/Project/GNU/CLI
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
```

### Build BWF MetaEdit GUI

If you have already build the CLI, no need to run git twice. In fact, if you re-run git with an existing BWF MetaEdit directory, git will complain and exit.

To compile BWF MetaEdit GUI under macOS and Linux:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MediaArea/BWFMetaEdit.git
cd BWFMetaEdit/Project/QtCreator
./prepare
make
```

## Build under Windows

*CLI and GUI dependencies*

* Microsoft Visual Studio with the Windows 8.1 SDK and the Git plugin (in the PATH)

*GUI only dependencies*

* Qt (in The PATH)

### Build BWF MetaEdit CLI


When you have done all the prerequisite for your configuration, then build BWF MetaEdit. We start with the CLI.

```bat
git clone https://github.com/MediaArea/BWFMetaEdit.git
devenv BWFMetaEdit\Project\MSVC2022\CLI\BWF_MetaEdit_CLI.vcxproj /upgrade
